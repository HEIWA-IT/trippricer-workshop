# Test

To test with the IDE cucmber plugin you must be sure to set the environment variables according to your need.  
In Intellij for example you need to add this line to the environment variables field of your run/debug cucumber configuration:
```LOG_PATH=/Volumes/DATA/var/log;API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:12378/trippricer/api/;ACCESS_CONTROL_AllOW_ORIGIN="*"```
